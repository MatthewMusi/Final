Abstract: 

Our collective metric to decide Pittsburgh's best neighborhood is the best overall neighborhood to play outside in safely during a pandemic. Our three metrics were the amount of playgrounds per neighborhood, population per neighborhood, and the amount of people tested, cases, and deaths of coronavirus per neighborhood. To have a fun time outside, many go to the park. The neighborhoods with the most total parks/playgrounds theoretically contain the most places to have fun while outdoors in this pandemic. Additionally, population density and coronavirus numbers go hand-in-hand. If a neighborhood has a high population, but has a low number of cases, then that neighborhood is safer to play outside in (and therefore use the playgrounds). We found that, with these three metrics, Squirrel Hill South is the best neighborhood. It has the most playgrounds, the highest population, and is one of the better neighborhoods coronavirus-wise (as it tests many people).
